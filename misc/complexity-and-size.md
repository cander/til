# Complexity and Size
I came across [Death by a Thousand Microservices](https://renegadeotter.com/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html)
by Andrei Taranchenko,
and it reminded me a lot of [Big Data is Dead](https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/)
by Jordan Tigani at [Mother Duck](https://motherduck.com).  I found myself
nodding along with both of them.

The basic message of
both articles is just because the Big Boys (FANGs) do stuff (microservices
or big data) doesn't mean you
should, especially when starting out. You can go very far with a monolith or
a single server or client database like [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org).  Of
course, there are always exceptions, but the odds are you are not one of
them.
