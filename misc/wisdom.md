- Rules about performance tuning:
  - Your first idea is almost surely wrong
  - You need real data, probably from a profiler
  - There's a good chance your second idea based on data is still wrong
  - Only change one thing at a time and be sure you know what you changed

## Quotes
- Knowlege comes, but wisdom lingers - Alfred Tennyson
