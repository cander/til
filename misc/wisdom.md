This is my (so small) version of
[Merlin Mann's](http://hotdogsladies.omg.lol/)
[Wisdom Project](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md).
It's an attempt to capture various bits of wisdom I've encountered or
learned the hard way. I'm writing them down for Future Me.
Merlin's caveats apply here, too - i.e., your milage may vary..

## General Wisdom
- Do you want to be right or happy? Mostly important when "arguing" with a
  significant other.
- Every job has BS. You can change jobs and escape the BS at your previous
  job, but the new job will have BS too, although you might not smell it
  initially. Enjoy.
- Read all the words. (via my friend Tom)
- Laws (that I can never remember the names of):
  - [Brook's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law) - "adding
    more individuals to a software project that is behind schedule delays it
    even longer."
  - [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law) -
    "Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly)
    will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's
    communication structure."
  - [Godwin's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law) -
    "as an online discussion grows longer (regardless of topic or scope),
    the probability of a comparison to Nazis or Adolf Hitler approaches 1."
  - [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) -
    "the duration of public administration, bureaucracy and officialdom
    expands to fill its allotted time span, regardless of the amount of work
    to be done."
  - [Horstman's Corollay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law#Corollaries) -
    "Work contracts to fit in the time we give it."
  - The Hopkins Principle - anything judged against a low enough standard
    can be made to look good.
- On the farm, the last one through the gate locks it.
- Related: You should check that gate before you walk away from it,
  regardless of who should have locked it.

## Technology Wisdom
- Rules about performance tuning:
  - Your first idea is almost surely wrong
  - You need real data, probably from a profiler
  - There's a good chance your second idea based on data is still wrong
  - Only change one thing at a time and be sure you know what you changed
  - Remember [Amdahl's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law) -
    just because you make something wicked-fast, doesn't mean you'll make
    the overall system wicked-fast. See above about data.
