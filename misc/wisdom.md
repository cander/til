This is my (so small) version of 
[Merlin Mann's](http://hotdogsladies.omg.lol/)
[Wisdom Project](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md).
It's an attempt to capture various bits of wisdom I've encountered or
learned the hard way. I'm writing them down for Future Me.
Merlin's caveats apply here, too - i.e., your milage may vary..

## General Wisdom
- Do you want to be right or happy? Mostly important when "arguing" with a
  significant other.
- Every job has BS. You can change jobs and escape the BS at your previous
  job, but the new job will have BS too, although you might not smell it
  initially. Enjoy.
- Read all the words. (via my friend Tom)

## Technology Wisdom
- Rules about performance tuning:
  - Your first idea is almost surely wrong
  - You need real data, probably from a profiler
  - There's a good chance your second idea based on data is still wrong
  - Only change one thing at a time and be sure you know what you changed
