# Platform Engineering

I just learned that "platform engineering" is a real thing/discipline/job.
It's even got a [site](https://platformengineering.org/) and a 
[conference](https://platformcon.com). I've been saying that I do backend
and platform development, and I respond to the title of "Platform Engineer",
but I just assumed that was just a thing at the places I worked.

Thanks to the [Software Engineering Radio
podcast](https://www.se-radio.net/2023/05/se-radio-565-luca-galante-on-platform-engineering/)
for cluing me in.
