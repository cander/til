# Ancient Ubuntu Docker Images

Need a really old version of Ubuntu to run in Docker?

See [iComputer7/ancient-ubuntu-docker](https://github.com/iComputer7/ancient-ubuntu-docker) 
on GitHub and DockerHub.

As the author notes, you do so at your own risk. In my case, I wanted a
really old version of `g++` in order to compile some 
[really old C++ code of mine](https://github.com/cander/pseudoflow-solver)
just to get an intelligible warning message that I could act on to modernize
the code a bit. I ended up running
[dapper](https://github.com/iComputer7/ancient-ubuntu-docker/tree/master/dapper).
